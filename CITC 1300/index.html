<h2>Godzilla 1954</h2>

<p> Godzilla was created and released in Japan in 1954 following the release and testing of nuclear weapons. Godzilla never stopped evolving due to the radiation waste and contamination in the oceans. His size during the creation of Godzilla 1954 was approximately 164 feet tall and changed rapidly over the years based on when the films were made. Before CGI and other animation effects, actors had to put on extremely heavy suits with no ventilation or protection and often overheated inside the giantâ€™s costume. Godzilla 1954 started a massive wave of fantasy movie curiosity, and Toho has created nearly 40 movies since Godzilla 1954, with comic books, games, and 70 years' worth of memorabilia all around the world. Depending on when the monster movie was directed and who directed it, different tones emerged throughout the films. Godzilla was portrayed as both good and evil, had a son, Minilla, and was a protector of Earth in almost every version of the film, always fighting off other monsters known as kaiju. Kaiju are other giant monsters like Godzilla.</p>
<h2>Godzilla Minus One</h2>

<p>Godzilla Minus One was a close throwback to the original Godzilla 1954. Godzilla starts young and continues to grow throughout the movie. He begins to evolve and gain new biological abilities such as rapid healing, charged atomic breath, and almost impenetrable skin. Godzilla is a villain in Godzilla Minus One, and combined with how the director kept him close to his roots, it was an absolutely breathtaking movie. Godzilla Minus One had an incredible CGI team and did not require any sort of man in a suit to earn his very first Oscar. </p>
<h2>Godzilla x Kong (2024)</h2>
